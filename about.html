While her degrees were generally in Environmental Science, she initially did pine snake and terrapin conservation research with a lab based in the New Jersey pinelands. For her masters degree, she transitioned labs into the ornithology department at the Academy of Natural Sciences, working with Jason Weckstein and Nate Rice. While at the Academy, she worked on many projects.
