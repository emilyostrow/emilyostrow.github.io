	<p>Emily is currently a fifth year Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Kansas looking for a job outside of academia with a special interest in infectious disease and parasitology. Her PhD work was originally inspired by identifying how parasites coevolve with their hosts by using feather lice and Great Horned Owls as a system. Her expertise includes using reduced-representation and full genomic analysis of population genomic datasets with diverse sources of phenotypic and environmental correlates. She takes price in being an interdisciplinary researcher and mentor and is particularly proud of two of her students publishing work she helped develop with them. Emily has taken on quite a few roles as a Ph.D. student including teaching, mentoring students, and collections management.</p>
	<h3>Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University</h3>
	<p>Emily did her bachelors and masters degrees in an accelerated program at Drexel University. Her initial research experience included pine snake and terrapin conservation research; however, she quickly fell in love with evolutionary biology. For her masters degree, she transitioned labs into the ornithology department at the Academy of Natural Sciences, working with Jason D. Weckstein and Nathan H. Rice. While at the Academy, she started a long-term project monitoring avian diseases such as Lyme disease and avian malaria at a local bird banding station, started and managed a blood film collection, and contributed to specimen acquisition and preparation. Her masters degree used next-generation sequencing data to assess toucan biogeography and relatedness.</p>
